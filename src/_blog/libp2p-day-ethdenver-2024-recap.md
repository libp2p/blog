## Introduction

Last month on February 29th, 2024, the libp2p community came together in
Denver, Colorado to hold the first libp2p Day in 2024 alongside the ETHDenver
conference.  

### SWOT Analaysis

At the end of the day we had our first "Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities
and Threats" (SWOT) session of 2024. The highlights of which are below.

- Strengths
  - Our community has expanded to include at least 5 implementations that are used in production.
  - There are several independent communities based around the different implementations. Most recently we connected with the nim-libp2p community who gave a talk about Waku at this event.
  - There is some funding to sustain the project going forward.
- Weaknesses 
  - Learning libp2p is still somewhat difficult.
- Opportunities
  - We can focus funding on creation of new learning materials such as Zoe's [Introduction to libp2p](https://libp2p.ecosystem-dashboard.com/home?range=7) on ProtoSchool.
  - Make libp2p into the go-to library for distributed systems researchers to do protocol research.
  - Focusing on mobile optimization and establish a community focused on libp2p on mobile devices.
- Threats
  - Continued funding is always going to be a threat to the health of the community.

## Talks

We had a great event with 12 different sessions focusing on topics
such as public goods funding, probing p2p networks, synchronization protocols
in blockchains, designing peer-to-peer social networks and others.
