## Retroactive Public Goods Funding for the libp2p ecosystem

Today, the libp2p project is excited to announce the **first ever** libp2p retroactive public goods funding round, libp2p-rPGF-1!

The libp2p project is [partnering with Gitcoin](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-x-libp2p-for-easy-rpgf/18446) to retroactively award $125,000 USD worth of OP, recognize impact, and further empower contributors to libp2p.
libp2p will be using a portion of its [Optimism rPGF round 3 rewards](https://vote.optimism.io/retropgf/3) to contribute back to the broader ecosystem!
This is an [Easy RPGF round](https://github.com/gitcoinco/easy-retro-pgf), will run on the Optimism chain, and is focused on rewarding projects and organizations that have made an impact across the libp2p ecosystem.

libp2p is a public good which powers much of the decentralized web including projects like Ethereum, Filecoin, Optimism, Polkadot, and more! Moreover, libp2p as a project is the result of many communities, collaborators, and organizations building together.

Often, these efforts go unrecognized and unrewarded since markets often fail to adequately fund public goods. Therefore, by embracing [RetroPGF](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf) libp2p seeks to bridge that funding gap.

At this time, our goal is to have about 2 retro PGF rounds per year. We will experiment and iterate each round and hope to evolve it so that governance, participation, and execution improve each round.

The rounds will follow the Optimism template:

1. ü™™ Badgeholders selection
1. üìù Nominations/Application submissions
1. üó≥ Voting by badgeholders
1. üìä Publish voting results
1. üí∞ Distribute rewards/funding
1. ü§î Retrospective to improve future rounds

For this first round, the badgeholder selection process will include input from stakeholders across the libp2p ecosystem. In upcoming rounds, the badgeholder selection process and pool will be further opened.

Anyone can nominate a project that has achieved impact in the past 12 months in one of the following categories:
- Software Dependencies
- Infrastructure, Tooling, & Utilities
- Education, Outreach, and Applications
- Research & Development
- Other

The round begins today! Nominate projects [in Github](https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p/discussions).
